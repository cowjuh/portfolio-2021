# How I sort of held 3 roles at AWS as a Front End Engineer Intern

I interned with AWS last summer as a Front End Engineer intern. 

## Intern Project
My intern project had very limited requirements scoped out, as it wasn't a "P0" requirement quite yet, so to speak. As a result, neither the product requirements document nor the design existed when I joined the team.

## My 4 hats

### Frontend Engineer
Coming in with only ReactJS and JS experience, I learned Typescript and Jest on the job and ensured not only quality code, but 100% tested frontend code. (It wasn't fun, but it was satisfying)

### Backend Engineer
Though I was hired for frontend, the project demanded backend changes that interfaced with DynamoDB + Elasticsearch and 2 new Java APIs. Oh yeah, I learned Java in a week to make those changes.

### PM
There was a "wishlist" for what the feature could be, but no tangible requirements. I scoped out the requirements, dividing them into MVP, stretch goals, and out-of-scope requirements.

### Product Designer
If there's no product requirements, you can bet there **definitely** aren't any designs ready to work off of. No problem for me, I'm honestly a better designer than I am a developer. To save the team's PD some time, I created and justified 3 form factors using Figma for my feature and got it approved in a single meeting. Not bad!

I also fought to do and get the designs approved **before** moving onto the engineering design. Thank god I did, because the design drastically affected my engineering design.

## Result
I truly **owned** this feature. I scoped its requirements, designed it in Figma, designed its high level architecture, designed the API, then carried out frontend and backend implementation and testing all **within my 12 week internship timeline**.

Oh yeah, I also killed it at the Intern Presentation day :) 

## Mentorship
But if we're being honest, I couldn't have done this alone! Some notable teammates:
1. Emily — My official mentor who is a bank of engineering (and general) knowledge helped me with my questions, environment setup, Java, ElasticSearch, DynamoDB, etc.
2. Caitlyn — My unofficial mentor who I can only describe as a Front end "god". She helped me tackle the monster that is **front end unit testing**. There were a ton of weird edge cases, strange browser behaviours.
3. Uygar — My manager, who didn't interact with me on as much of a granular level, but kept me on the right track gave me genuine, constructive feedback.

Couldn't have done it without them, and had a great time interning with AWS :)
