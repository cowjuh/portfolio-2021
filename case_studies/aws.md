# How I sort of held 3 roles at AWS as a Front End Engineer Intern

I interned with AWS last summer as a Front End Engineer intern. 

## Intern Project
My intern project had very limited requirements scoped out, as it wasn't a "P0" requirement quite yet, so to speak. As a result, neither the product requirements document nor the design existed when I joined the team.

The different hats I wore

### Frontend Engineer
Coming in with only ReactJS and JS experience, I learned Typescript and Jest on the job and ensured not only quality code, but 100% tested frontend code. (It wasn't fun, but it was satisfying)

### Backend Engineer
Though I was hired for frontend, the project demanded backend changes that interfaced with DynamoDB + Elasticsearch and 2 new Java APIs. Oh yeah, I learned Java in a week to make those changes.

### PM
There was a "wishlist" for what the feature could be, but no tangible requirements. I scoped out the requirements, dividing them into MVP, stretch goals, and out-of-scope requirements.

### Product Designer
If there's no product requirements, you can bet there **definitely** aren't any designs ready to work off of. No problem for me, I'm honestly a better designer than I am a developer. To save the team's PD some time, I created and justified 3 form factors using Figma for my feature and got it approved in a single meeting. Not bad!

## Mentors
Although my role was focused on Front End, my intern project was actually full stack, which helped me grow a ton as an engineer. My official mentor, Emily, was a mountain of knowledge who was able to answer virtually any question I threw at her. She helped me learn Java, ElasticSearch, and DynamoDB so I could complete my internship project.

My unofficial mentor, Caitlyn, was a Front End "god", so to say. She helped me tackle the monster that is **front end unit testing**. There were a ton of weird edge cases, strange browser behaviours,.
