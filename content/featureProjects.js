  problemParagraph: [
    "People with visual impairments are faced with potentially catastrophic situations when walking near open roads, quiet electric cars, or unusual obstacles, where the slightest deviation in their angle can have huge effects.",
  ],
  solution: [
    "An assistive device which uses computer vision to detect if its user is deviating from the sidewalk while alerting them of obstacles.",

  outcome: [
    "I taught UX Research Design to engineers",
    "We interviewed 11 people with visual impairments",
    "The interview data helped us make educated design decisions, leading to a simpler product that solves a real problem.",
    "The product shifted its focus towards helping its users walk straight while detecting obstacles.",
